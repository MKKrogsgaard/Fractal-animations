# Fractal animations
 Animations of the Mandelbrot set and (possibly) other fractals. The animation can be created with `mandelbrot_video_cuda.py`, which depends on numba cuda and hence only works on NVIDIA GPUs.

 `mandelbrot_frame.py` uses only the CPU to generate a single frame, and does not require a NVIDIA GPU.
